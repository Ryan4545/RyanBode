            <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 15%; margin-right: 15%; line-height: 180%; text-align: left;">Hello, my name is Ryan Bode and I am full stack developer. 
                I have years of experience working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, C#, TypeScript, Java, and Python. I have worked in many positions from software development to IT management which I feel has helped give 
                me a well rounded view of computer technology in its entirety.<br />

                    Apple Genius Bar: I worked previously in the Apple Genius bar which allowed me to develop and grow my skills around troubleshooting various computer and mobile device issues.
                    In this position I worked with my colleagues to develop a complete solution for customers and solve any issues they came in with. I worked directly with Apple software and

                    CB Flooring, LLC: At CB Flooring I worked as their IT system manager with the primary responsibility of migrating their IT infastructure into the Azure cloud from on prem servers.

                    and program a full functioning robot. In this position I was in charge of keeping my team on track and making sure things were working properly. I worked with Java, Python, and JavaScript
